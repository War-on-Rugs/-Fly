The ERC1155Base contract integrates ERC1155 token functionality with modular capabilities, providing hooks for minting, burning, transferring, and metadata updates. This contract is ideal for projects requiring flexible token operations and works well with modules that add extra features to ERC1155 token management. ERC721 All NFTs in the contract have shared metadata except that each NFT has its unique token ID appended to the NFT's name. An admin can set this shared metadata at any time. The contract does not require the admin to set a limit to the total supply of NFTs. The admin can set claim phases (like in NFT Drop) to apply restrictions on the minting of NFTs, such as a price, mint start and end times, etc. Getting started to add ERC-4337 compatible smart accounts to your application easily, Let users connect to their smart account using any personal wallet: including in-app wallets for easy onboarding. Automatically deploy individual account contracts for your users when they do their first onchain transaction. Handle all transaction gas costs via paymaster.
