ðŸ¦‹ $FLY to the moon!: On February 20, 1947, the United States sent a V-2 rocket containing fruit flies into space to study the effects of radiation on living organisms and to see if the radiation from space would be a potential problem for future astronauts. The flight was launched from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and lasted a total of three minutes. All the flies returned to Earth untouched by radiation. These flies paved the way for space-bound monkeys in 1949, dogs in 1957, and eventually humans in 1961. Fly with us to the moon!
ðŸš€ðŸŒ•ðŸ“ˆ So $FLY the rest larvae.
