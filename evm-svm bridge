Deployment Models＃ Native Token Transfers (NTT) provides an adaptable framework for transferring your native tokens across different blockchains. Unlike traditional wrapped assets, NTT maintains your token's native properties on every chain. This ensures that you retain complete control over crucial aspects, such as metadata, ownership, upgradeability, and custom features.

Hub-and-spoke: Locks tokens on a central "hub" chain and mints equivalents on "spoke" chains, maintaining the total supply on the hub. It's ideal for integrating existing tokens onto new blockchains without altering their original contracts.

Native Token Transfers primarily support ERC-20 tokens, the most widely used standard for fungible assets on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains, including ERC-20 Burnable tokens, which can be burned on the source chain during cross-chain transfers when required. It also supports fungible SPL tokens on SVM-supported chains for secure cross-chain transfers.

The NttManager is a contract that oversees the secure and reliable transfer of native tokens across supported blockchains. It leverages the standard IERC20 interface and OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 library to interact with these tokens securely across chains.

NTT does not currently support non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or multi-token standards like ERC-1155. Support is limited to ERC-20 tokens.

Deployment Process＃
Here's a breakdown of the key steps involved when deploying NTT:

Prepare tokens: Ensure your ERC-20 or SPL tokens are ready.
Choose deployment model: Choose your cross-chain token model: either burn-and-mint or hub-and-spoke.
Initialization: Specify target chains and token details, and set up your CLI environment if using it.
Deploy contracts: Deploy NTT Manager contracts to all selected chains, confirming transactions and covering gas fees.
Finalize configurations: Grant minting authority, configure rate limits, establish peer manager connections (bilateral via setPeer / set_peer; local configuration, no cross-chain message), and assign administrative roles.
Monitor and maintain: Verify deployment, monitor total supply with the Global Accountant, and adjust configurations as needed.
